# Employee Atrition rate
I used python to develop a model thats predicts if an employee will leave the company or not. 

# BUSINESS PROBLEM
“Attrition in human resources refers to the gradual loss of employees over time. In general, relatively high attrition is problematic for companies. HR professionals often assume a leadership role in designing company compensation programs, work culture and motivation systems that help the organization retain top employees.”

My role is to uncover the factors that lead to employee attrition through Exploratory Data Analysis, and explore them by using various classification models to predict if an employee is likely to quit. This could greatly increase the HR’s ability to intervene on time and remedy the situation to prevent attrition.

While this model can be routinely run to identify employees, who are most likely to quit, the key driver of success would be the human element of reaching out the employee, understanding the current situation of the employee and taking action to remedy controllable factors that can prevent attrition of the employee.
